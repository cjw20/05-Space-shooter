# 05-Space-shooter
This repository contains a simple space shooter for MSCH-C220 at Indiana University.

Once running main.py you control the space ship my moving the mouse around the window. The left mouse button fires a bullet when pressed. That bullet damages and destroys the meteors. Your score is tracked by how many meteors you hit and destroy before colliding with one of them. After colliding with a meteor, the game is over and your score is displayed in the terminal.
